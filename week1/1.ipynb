       "Creating a new ethical framework for AI decision-making in healthcare is a complex task that requires balancing multiple priorities and values. Here are key principles I would prioritize:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Principles\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Patient Autonomy**: Respecting patients' rights to make informed decisions about their own healthcare is fundamental. AI systems should support, rather than undermine, patient autonomy by providing clear and comprehensible information about treatment options, risks, and benefits.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Beneficence**: The primary goal of AI in healthcare should be to promote the well-being of patients. AI systems should aim to enhance the quality of care, improve health outcomes, and provide actionable insights that lead to better decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Non-maleficence**: AI systems must avoid causing harm. This involves rigorous testing, validation, and continuous monitoring to minimize risks associated with AI recommendations and ensure patient safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Justice**: AI applications in healthcare must be designed to promote equity. This includes avoiding bias in data and algorithms, ensuring accessibility for all patient populations, and preventing disparities in care.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Transparency**: AI decision-making processes should be transparent. Patients and healthcare providers need to understand how AI systems work, how decisions are made, and what data is used, fostering trust and accountability.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Informed Consent**: Patients should be fully informed about how AI will be used in their care and what data will be collected. Consent processes should be clear and significant to maintain respect for patient autonomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Collaboration**: AI should be viewed as a tool to augment the capabilities of healthcare professionals rather than replace them. Collaborative decision-making should involve multidisciplinary teams, ensuring that human judgment and expertise remain central.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Responsibility and Accountability**: Clear lines of accountability must be established with respect to the use of AI in healthcare. This includes determining who is responsible for AI decisions and their outcomes, including penalties for negligent usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Addressing Conflicts Between Patient Autonomy and Public Health\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Shared Decision-Making**: Encourage a framework that prioritizes shared decision-making, where healthcare providers engage patients in discussions about their treatment choices while also considering public health implications. This should involve a mutual understanding of how individual choices can impact community health.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Balancing Individual and Collective Health**: When public health considerations conflict with individual patient choices (e.g., vaccination, quarantine during outbreaks), clear communication of the reasons behind recommendations is crucial. Explain the broader implications of individual decisions on public health outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Ethical Guidelines for Override Situations**: Establish ethical guidelines for scenarios where patient autonomy may need to be overridden for the sake of public health. These guidelines should prioritize the least restrictive alternative, ensuring that individual rights are respected wherever possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Community Engagement**: Involve community stakeholders in discussions about public health measures and the role of AI. This inclusion helps align individual values with community health needs, creating a sense of ownership and shared responsibility.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement systems for feedback from patients and the community regarding AI decisions, allowing for ongoing dialogue and adjustment of public health initiatives based on real-world impacts and individual values.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Education and Awareness**: Promote educational programs that enhance public understanding of AI in healthcare, public health imperatives, and the importance of collaborative healthcare decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "An ethical framework for AI decision-making in healthcare should navigate the tension between patient autonomy and public health considerations thoughtfully. By implementing principles of respect, equity, transparency, collaboration, and community engagement, we can create a balanced approach that serves both individual patients and the broader population."

       "## A New Ethical Framework for AI in Healthcare: Patient-Centric and Equity-Driven\n",
       "\n",
       "My proposed ethical framework for AI decision-making in healthcare would be built on the following core principles, designed to be both patient-centric and sensitive to public health considerations:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Transparency and Explainability (Understanding the \"Why\"):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Principle:** AI algorithms and their decision-making processes must be transparent and explainable to both healthcare professionals and patients (where appropriate).\n",
       "*   **Implementation:**\n",
       "    *   Develop AI systems with explainable AI (XAI) techniques that can provide insights into the factors driving predictions and recommendations.\n",
       "    *   Create understandable summaries of AI-driven recommendations for clinicians to share with patients, highlighting the benefits, risks, and uncertainties.\n",
       "    *   Document the data used to train the AI, the algorithm's limitations, and potential biases.\n",
       "    *   Implement auditability, allowing for independent review of the AI's decision-making process in specific cases.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Fairness and Non-Discrimination (Equal Access and Outcomes):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Principle:** AI algorithms must be fair and avoid perpetuating or exacerbating existing health disparities.\n",
       "*   **Implementation:**\n",
       "    *   Use diverse and representative datasets for training AI models, actively identifying and mitigating potential biases related to race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, age, disability, and other protected characteristics.\n",
       "    *   Conduct rigorous testing and validation across different demographic groups to ensure equitable performance.\n",
       "    *   Implement bias detection and mitigation tools throughout the AI development lifecycle.\n",
       "    *   Establish monitoring systems to track the AI's impact on different patient populations and identify any emerging disparities.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Patient Autonomy and Informed Consent (Right to Choose):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Principle:** Patients have the right to understand, question, and decline AI-driven recommendations about their health.\n",
       "*   **Implementation:**\n",
       "    *   Provide patients with clear and accessible information about the use of AI in their care, including its potential benefits, risks, and limitations.\n",
       "    *   Obtain explicit informed consent from patients before using AI-driven tools to make decisions about their health.\n",
       "    *   Ensure that patients have the right to a human-in-the-loop approach, where a clinician reviews and approves AI recommendations and incorporates patient preferences and values.\n",
       "    *   Offer alternative treatment options that do not rely on AI, if desired by the patient.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Privacy and Data Security (Protecting Sensitive Information):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Principle:** Patient data must be protected with the highest standards of privacy and security.\n",
       "*   **Implementation:**\n",
       "    *   Implement robust data encryption and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and use of patient data.\n",
       "    *   Adhere to all applicable data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and GDPR.\n",
       "    *   Ensure that patient data is used solely for the intended purpose and not shared with third parties without explicit consent.\n",
       "    *   Implement anonymization and de-identification techniques to protect patient privacy when using data for research or algorithm development.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Accountability and Oversight (Responsibility and Redress):**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Principle:** There must be clear lines of accountability for the development, deployment, and use of AI in healthcare.\n",
       "*   **Implementation:**\n",
       "    *   Establish a clear framework for assigning responsibility for the decisions made by AI systems, including developers, healthcare providers, and institutions.\n",
       "    *   Create mechanisms for patients to report errors or biases in AI-driven care and seek redress for any harm caused.\n",
       "    *   Establish independent oversight bodies to monitor the performance and impact of AI systems in healthcare and ensure compliance with ethical guidelines.\n",
       "    *   Develop clear protocols for addressing errors or malfunctions in AI systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Addressing Conflicts Between Patient Autonomy and Public Health Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Conflicts between patient autonomy and public health can arise in situations where AI-driven decisions impact not only the individual but also the broader community. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Infectious Disease Control:** AI could be used to predict and prevent outbreaks, potentially recommending mandatory testing or quarantine measures that could infringe on individual liberties.\n",
       "*   **Resource Allocation:** AI could be used to allocate scarce resources (e.g., ventilators) during a pandemic, potentially prioritizing certain patient groups over others based on factors such as age or comorbidities.\n",
       "\n",
       "To address these conflicts, I propose the following strategies:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Prioritize Transparency and Communication:**  Openly communicate the public health rationale behind AI-driven interventions, emphasizing the potential benefits for the community as a whole. Explain the risks of not implementing the intervention and address any concerns raised by individuals.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Seek Broad Societal Input:** Consult with diverse stakeholders, including patients, healthcare professionals, ethicists, and community leaders, to develop AI-driven policies that reflect societal values and priorities.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Emphasize Proportionality and Least Restrictive Means:**  Ensure that AI-driven interventions are proportionate to the risk posed to public health and that less restrictive alternatives are considered first.  Avoid unnecessary infringements on individual liberties.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Implement Due Process and Appeals Mechanisms:**  Provide individuals with the opportunity to challenge AI-driven decisions that affect their rights or freedoms.  Establish clear procedures for appealing such decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Focus on Education and Empowerment:**  Educate the public about the benefits of AI in healthcare and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their own health.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Regularly Re-evaluate and Adapt:**  Recognize that the ethical landscape of AI is constantly evolving.  Continuously re-evaluate and adapt AI-driven policies to reflect changing societal values and scientific knowledge.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary,** this ethical framework prioritizes transparency, fairness, patient autonomy, privacy, and accountability. It recognizes that AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but only if it is developed and used responsibly, ethically, and in a way that benefits all members of society. By prioritizing these principles and implementing these strategies, we can harness the power of AI to improve health outcomes while upholding fundamental human rights and values.\n"

    "Before you start: remember to update the files in the \"me\" directory - your LinkedIn profile and summary.txt - so that it talks about you! Also change `self.name = \"Ed Donner\"` in `app.py`..  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also check that there's no README file within the 1_foundations directory. If there is one, please delete it. The deploy process creates a new README file in this directory for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit https://huggingface.co and set up an account  \n",
    "2. From the Avatar menu on the top right, choose Access Tokens. Choose \"Create New Token\". Give it WRITE permissions - it needs to have WRITE permissions! Keep a record of your new key.  \n",
    "3. In the Terminal, run: `uv tool install 'huggingface_hub[cli]'` to install the HuggingFace tool, then `hf auth login` to login at the command line with your key. Afterwards, run `hf auth whoami` to check you're logged in  \n",
    "4. Take your new token and add it to your .env file: `HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx` for the future\n",
    "5. From the 1_foundations folder, enter: `uv run gradio deploy` \n",
    "6. Follow its instructions: name it \"career_conversation\", specify app.py, choose cpu-basic as the hardware, say Yes to needing to supply secrets, provide your openai api key, your pushover user and token, and say \"no\" to github actions.  \n",

    "\n",
    "And if you don't want to set secrets this way, or something goes wrong with it, it's no problem - you can change your secrets later:  \n",
