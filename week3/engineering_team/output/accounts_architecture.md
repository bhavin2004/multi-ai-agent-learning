#### 2. System Components

1. **User Account Management**
   - **Component**: `AccountService`
     - Responsibilities:
       - Manage user registration.
       - Handle deposit and withdrawal of funds.
       - Validate funds for operations.
   - **Component**: `UserAccount` (Data Model)
     - Attributes:
       - `UserID` (Primary Key)
       - `Username`
       - `Password` (hashed)
       - `Email`
       - `Balance`
       - `Holdings` (dictionary of share symbols and quantities)
       - `Transactions` (list of transaction records)

2. **Transaction Management**
   - **Component**: `TransactionService`
     - Responsibilities:
       - Record buy/sell transactions.
       - Ensure validations for the transactions (such as checks for sufficient shares and funds).
   - **Component**: `Transaction` (Data Model)
     - Attributes:
       - `TransactionID` (Primary Key)
       - `UserID` (Foreign Key)
       - `ShareSymbol`
       - `Quantity`
       - `TransactionType` (buy/sell)
       - `Timestamp`

3. **Portfolio Management**
   - **Component**: `PortfolioService`
     - Responsibilities:
       - Calculate total portfolio value.
       - Determine profit or loss from the initial deposit.
       - Reporting functionality for holdings and transaction history.

4. **Share Price Management**
   - **Component**: `SharePriceService`
     - Responsibilities:
       - Interface with the `get_share_price(symbol)` function.
       - Fetch current price of shares for portfolio calculations.

5. **User Interface**
   - **Component**: `UserInterface`
     - Responsibilities:
       - Provide forms for user account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction input.
       - Display portfolio and transaction history.

6. **Database Management**
   - **Technology**: **Relational Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL)
     - Responsibilities:
       - Store user account details, transactions, and portfolio data securely.

#### 3. Data Flows Between Components

1. **User Registration Flow**
   - User submits registration data via `UserInterface`.
   - `UserInterface` calls `AccountService` with the registration data.
   - `AccountService` creates a new `UserAccount` and stores it in the database.
   - Confirmation message sent back to `UserInterface`.

2. **Funds Deposit Flow**
   - User submits a deposit request via `UserInterface`.
   - `UserInterface` sends the request to `AccountService`.
   - `AccountService` validates deposit, updates `UserAccount` balance, and stores the transaction in `TransactionService` and `Transaction` record.
   - Confirmation message sent back to `UserInterface`.

3. **Transaction Recording Flow**
   - User submits buy/sell order via `UserInterface`.
   - `UserInterface` calls `TransactionService` to validate and process the transaction.
   - `TransactionService` checks if funds/shares are sufficient; if valid, it updates holdings and balance in `UserAccount` and records the transaction.
   - Confirmation message sent back to `UserInterface`.

4. **Portfolio Valuation Flow**
   - User requests portfolio valuation.
   - `UserInterface` queries `PortfolioService`.
   - `PortfolioService` retrieves holdings from `UserAccount`, fetches current prices from `SharePriceService`, and calculates the total portfolio value.
   - Returns report to `UserInterface` for display.

5. **Reporting Flow**
   - User requests to view transaction history or holdings.
   - `UserInterface` queries `PortfolioService` to gather the required data.
   - `PortfolioService` compiles the data and sends it back to `UserInterface` for representation.

#### 4. Technology Stack

1. **Backend**
   - Language: **Python** (for API development)
   - Framework: **Flask** or **Django** (for RESTful services)
   
2. **Database**
   - Type: **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** 

3. **Frontend**
   - Framework: **React** or **Angular** (for rich user interface)
   - Communication: **Axios** or **Fetch API** for RESTful communication with the backend.

4. **Testing**
   - Unit Testing: **pytest** for backend, **Jest** for frontend.

5. **Deployment**
   - Platform: **Docker** for containerization, **Kubernetes** for orchestration, and potentially **AWS** for cloud infrastructure.
