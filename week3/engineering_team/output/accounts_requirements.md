#### 2. Functional Requirements Breakdown

1. **Account Management**
   - **Feature**: User Registration
     - **Description**: Users should be able to create an account by providing necessary details such as username, password, and email.
     - **User Scenario**: A new user fills out the account creation form and submits it successfully.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
       - User receives a confirmation message upon successful registration.
       - User details are stored securely in the database.

   - **Feature**: Deposit Funds
     - **Description**: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
     - **User Scenario**: A user deposits $100 into their account.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Account balance reflects the updated total after the transaction.
       - A confirmation notification is displayed.

   - **Feature**: Withdraw Funds
     - **Description**: Users may withdraw funds from their accounts under certain conditions.
     - **User Scenario**: A user attempts to withdraw $50 from an account with a $100 balance.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Withdrawal is successful if funds are adequate.
       - System prevents withdrawal if balance is insufficient.

2. **Share Transactions**
   - **Feature**: Record Buy/Sell of Shares
     - **Description**: Users can buy or sell shares, specifying the quantity and symbol.
     - **User Scenario**: A user buys 10 shares of AAPL.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - System checks user balance; if adequate, the transaction is recorded, and holdings are updated.
       - System reflects the buy/sell transaction in the transaction history.

   - **Feature**: Prevent Invalid Transactions
     - **Description**: System must enforce rules to prevent invalid buy/sell operations.
     - **User Scenario**: A user tries to sell shares they do not own or exceed affordable limits.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - System blocks the transaction and displays an error message (e.g., “Insufficient shares to sell” or “Not enough funds”).

3. **Portfolio Management**
   - **Feature**: Calculate Total Portfolio Value
     - **Description**: The system calculates and displays the total value of a user’s portfolio based on current share prices.
     - **User Scenario**: A user requests their portfolio value after buying shares.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Total portfolio value displayed accurately reflects current share prices and quantities.

   - **Feature**: Calculate Profit/Loss
     - **Description**: System calculates profit or loss from the user's initial deposit and current total portfolio value.
     - **User Scenario**: A user checks their profit/loss after making several trades.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - Profit/loss calculation is accurate based on the changes in the portfolio value compared to the initial deposit.

4. **Reporting Functions**
   - **Feature**: Report Holdings
     - **Description**: Users can view current holdings at any time, including share quantities and values.
     - **User Scenario**: A user views their current share holdings.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - System accurately lists all shares held, their quantities, and the total value of each holding.

   - **Feature**: Transaction History
     - **Description**: Users can review their past transactions categorized by buy/sell operations.
     - **User Scenario**: A user checks their transaction history for the last month.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**:
       - System lists all transactions, categorized by type (buy/sell), with amounts and dates.

#### 3. Edge Cases

1. **Withdrawal Limitations**
   - Attempting to withdraw an amount greater than the current balance.
   - Attempting to withdraw when there are pending transactions that would result in a negative balance.

2. **Buying/Selling Restrictions**
   - Trying to buy shares when insufficient funds are available (e.g., trying to buy shares with a zero balance).
   - Attempting to sell more shares than the user currently possesses.

3. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Multiple transaction requests submitted at the same time, ensuring the system processes each one correctly without incorrect balance computations.

4. **Initial Deposits and Withdrawals**
   - Users attempting to create an account without making an initial deposit and handling of accounts with $0 balances.
