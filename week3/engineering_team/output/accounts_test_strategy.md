#### 2. Test Scenarios and Test Cases

**2.1 Account Management**

- **Feature: User Registration**
  - **Test Case 1.1**: Validate successful account creation
    - **Scenario**: A user submits valid registration details.
    - **Expected Outcome**: User receives a confirmation of successful registration, and user data is stored in the database.
  
  - **Test Case 1.2**: Validate failure for duplicate usernames
    - **Scenario**: A user attempts to register with an already-existing username.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System returns an error message indicating that the username is already taken.

- **Feature: Deposit Funds**
  - **Test Case 2.1**: Validate successful deposit
    - **Scenario**: A user deposits $100 into their account.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Account balance updates correctly, and a confirmation notification is displayed.

  - **Test Case 2.2**: Validate failure for invalid deposit amount
    - **Scenario**: A user attempts to deposit a negative amount (-$50).
    - **Expected Outcome**: System displays an error message indicating that the deposit amount must be positive.

- **Feature: Withdraw Funds**
  - **Test Case 3.1**: Validate successful withdrawal
    - **Scenario**: A user withdraws $50 from an account with a balance of $100.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Withdrawal is successful, and the account balance updates accordingly.

  - **Test Case 3.2**: Validate failure for insufficient funds
    - **Scenario**: A user tries to withdraw $150 from an account with a balance of $100.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System prevents the transaction and displays an error message.

**2.2 Share Transactions**

- **Feature: Record Buy/Sell of Shares**
  - **Test Case 4.1**: Validate successful buy transaction
    - **Scenario**: A user purchases 10 shares of AAPL.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Holdings are updated correctly and show the new quantity.

  - **Test Case 4.2**: Validate failure for buying without sufficient funds
    - **Scenario**: A user attempts to buy shares with insufficient balance.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System displays an error message indicating insufficient funds.

  - **Test Case 4.3**: Validate successful sell transaction
    - **Scenario**: A user sells 5 shares of TSLA.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Holdings are updated correctly, reflecting the reduction in shares.

  - **Test Case 4.4**: Validate failure for selling non-owned shares
    - **Scenario**: A user tries to sell 5 shares of GOOGL when they own none.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System displays an error indicating insufficient shares to sell.

**2.3 Portfolio Management**

- **Feature: Calculate Total Portfolio Value**
  - **Test Case 5.1**: Validate portfolio value calculation post transactions
    - **Scenario**: User requests portfolio value after executing some buy and sell transactions.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System returns accurate total portfolio value based on current share prices.

- **Feature: Calculate Profit/Loss**
  - **Test Case 6.1**: Validate profit/loss calculation
    - **Scenario**: A user checks profit/loss after trading.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System accurately calculates and displays profit/loss based on the initial deposit and current value.

**2.4 Reporting Functions**

- **Feature: Report Holdings**
  - **Test Case 7.1**: Validate holdings report
    - **Scenario**: A user requests their current holdings.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System lists all shares held and their respective values accurately.

- **Feature: Transaction History**
  - **Test Case 8.1**: Validate transaction history retrieval
    - **Scenario**: A user requests transaction history for the last month.
    - **Expected Outcome**: System displays all transactions in chronological order with relevant details.

---

#### 3. Integration Testing

- **Test Case 9.1**: Validate interaction between AccountService and TransactionService
  - **Scenario**: User deposits funds, then buys shares.
  - **Expected Outcome**: System correctly updates user balance after deposit and reflects records of the transaction in the account history.

- **Test Case 9.2**: Validate interaction between PortfolioService and SharePriceService
  - **Scenario**: User requests total portfolio value.
  - **Expected Outcome**: System fetches current share prices correctly, computes total value, and displays it to the user.

---

#### 4. Edge Cases

1. **Withdrawal Limits**
   - Test cases for attempting to withdraw more than the balance or during pending transactions.

2. **Buying/Selling Restrictions**
   - Testing scenarios for buying shares with a zero or negative balance and selling shares that are not owned.

3. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Simulating multiple transaction requests to ensure balance integrity is maintained.

4. **Initial Deposits and Withdrawals**
   - Handling scenarios where a new account tries to operate without any initial funds.

---

#### 5. Testing Tools and Responsibilities

- **Tools for Testing**: 
  - **Unit Testing**: `pytest` for backend testing to automate tests for APIs and functionalities.
  - **Integration Testing**: `Postman` for user operations or `pytest` with integration test setups.
  - **Frontend Testing**: `Jest` for UI components testing in JavaScript frameworks.

- **Responsibilities**: 
  - QA Team will oversee the execution of test cases, documentation of results, and identification of defects.
  - Developers will conduct unit tests during development cycles to ensure component integrity before integration tests.

#### 6. Conclusion
This comprehensive testing strategy for the Accounts Module ensures that all functionalities are rigorously tested, edge cases are handled, and integration points are validated. By implementing unit and integration testing across the described scenarios, we aim to deliver a robust solution that meets user expectations and maintains system integrity throughout its lifecycle.
